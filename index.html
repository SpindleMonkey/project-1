          <h2>How to play</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>When your team is up, you'll be asked to select a player from a dropdown (the player will be from the other team); this is the player you'll ask for when you call 'Red Rover, Red Rover, send so-and-so on over!'</li>
          <li>The other team will then be prompted to send their player over</li>
          <li>The other team's player will then scramble across the field towards your team and try to break through the linked arms of 2 of your players</li>
          <li>If your team prevents the other team's player from breaking through, you get to add that player to your team!</li>
          <li>However, if the other team's player breaks through, the other team keeps their player and picks one of your players to add to their team :(</li>
          <li>Repeat the above steps until either one team has all the players, or there's only 1 player left on the team that's up (1 player, unfortunately, cannot keep the other team from breaking through because there's nobody for that lone player to link arms with!)</li>
