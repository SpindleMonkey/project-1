Project 1 for WDI4

### Overview

Remember those games we played as children? Dodge ball? Tag? Hide and seek? This is a bitter/cynical recreation of my childhood nightmare: Red Rover.

This is a two-player game, with each player (or captain) leading a team of mammals (1st graders? thugs? zombies? raccoons? actual mammals are still TBD). Team-size is determined by the players before the game starts. 

Using animation and DOM manipulation to show the results, each team will alternate "Red Rover, Red Rover, send [insert your least liked mammal on the other team] right over" requests, until only 1 mammal remains on the losing team.

Possible upgrades to the game include:
* scoreboard showing top 5 teams
* varying health/strength/likeability scores for each of the team members that are updated after
each round
* random aids allocated to each team at the start of a new game (e.g., grenades, stink bombs)
* ability to pick your team members
